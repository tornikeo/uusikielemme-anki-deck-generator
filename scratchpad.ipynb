       "In this article, you can find some vocabulary and phrases for yoga in Finnish. I’m basing this article on a video by [Ninan jooga](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQcjlVqbs8wmyOe1u-NZBRQ). I’ve picked a small part of [this video](https://youtu.be/-tc86UJlWR0?t=32) to analyze. I specifically picked the part of the video that deals with stretching left and right over your head. It’s a fairly simple thing to do, so perfect to start with. If you are interested in more of this type of content, let me know in the comments!\n",
